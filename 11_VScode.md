# Chapter 11. Using GitHub in VScode or PyCharm

> At this stage, you should be able to set up your own github project and recognise the different commands to upload repositories via the command line.
>
> If however, you prefer the simplicity of a GUI, then we can avoid the back and forth of terminal commands by using the GitHub extension in either VScode or PyCharm. 
>
> If you want to practice, then please download VScode and/or PyCharm:
>
> [VSCode downloads page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
> [PyCharm downloads page](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download)
>
> then follow one of below depending on the software: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview
>
> [VSCode Git](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview#_git-support)
> [PyCharm Git](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/using-git-integration.html)
>
> You can either initialise a new repository or clone an existing one (like the one/s we created in the workshop) to directly work on. Give it a go!
