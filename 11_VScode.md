# Chapter 11. Using GitHub in VScode

> At this stage, you should be able to set up your own github project and recognise the different commands to upload repositories via the command line.
>
> If however, you prefer the simplicity of a GUI, then we can avoid the back and forth of terminal commands by using the GitHub extension in VScode. 
>
> If you want to practice, then please follow: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview 
>
> You can either initialise a new repository or clone an existing one (like the one/s we created in the workshop) to directly work on. Give it a go!
