# Chapter 11. Using GitHub in VScode or PyCharm

At this stage, you should be able to set up your own github project and recognise the different commands to upload repositories via the command line.

If however, you prefer the simplicity of a GUI, then we can avoid the back and forth of terminal commands by using the GitHub extension in either VScode or PyCharm. 

If you want to practice, then:

> *1) download VScode and/or PyCharm:*
>
> [VSCode downloads page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
> 
> [PyCharm downloads page](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download)
>
>
> *2) follow one of below depending on the software:* 
>
> [VSCode Git](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview#_git-support)
> 
> [PyCharm Git](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/using-git-integration.html)

You can either initialise a new repository or clone an existing one (like the one/s we created in the workshop) to directly work on. Give it a go!
