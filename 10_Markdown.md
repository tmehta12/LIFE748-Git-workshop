# 10. Markdown

> The `README.md` file we've just created uses a format called Markdown (.md).

> This is a very simple text file format that allows a computer to render our text nicely.

> You can dig into the format by reading the [documentation on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/about-writing-and-formatting-on-github).
