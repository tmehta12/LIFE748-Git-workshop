## Chapter 2. Initialising an empty local repository

### Learning outcomes

Now that we've made a workspace directory, we need to initialise an empty git repository:

~~~console
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/mehtat/Desktop/random-reads/.git/ # this will be different for each user
~~~

> This command has created a new directory in the `random-reads` directory called `.git`.
> As it starts with a dot, it is hidden (at least in bash), so we need to use the `-a` argument in `ls` to see it:

~~~console
$ ls -a
./    ../   .git/
~~~

Check that git thinks that the repository is OK:

~~~console
$ git status
On branch main

No commits yet

nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
~~~

> The above message is saying that there is a repository here, but that it is empty.

### Key Points
> git init initializes a repository.
> Git stores all of its repository data in the .git directory.
