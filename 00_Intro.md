# Introduction

This workshop provides a beginners introduction on how git can be used "in real life".

> **NB**: This is a brief overview of a complex topic.
> As you progress in the use of Git, you will encounter all types of things from unclear documentations, how GitHub forums can provide additional info, and general navigation.

> If you want to engage in further (and more in-depth) content beyond the basics in this workshop, then please look at the [Version Control with Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) lesson on Software Carpentry.
